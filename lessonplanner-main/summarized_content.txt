 It seems you've shared a JavaScript code snippet that fetches video data, checks if the user is logged in and handles various events like play, save, and like for a video element. The code also generates related videos based on an input `video_data` and `course_link`. However, there are several issues with the provided code:

1. There are multiple inconsistencies in variable naming conventions and indentation. For instance, some variables use camelCase (e.g., `main_videoslug`), while others use snake_case (e.g., `video_data`).
2. The code snippet is missing essential imports and dependencies for the Video.js library and any other external libraries required.
3. There are unused variables, functions, and comments that can be removed to make the code more readable.
4. The provided function `getVideoData()` doesn't exist in the given code snippet. It should be defined before making calls to it.
5. There are several instances of inline conditional statements that can be refactored into separate functions or variables.
6. The code lacks proper error handling and validation for user inputs.
7. The `formatDate()` function is not defined in the given code snippet.
8. There are missing closing brackets, parentheses, and quotation marks in several places.

To improve this code:

1. Use consistent naming conventions throughout the code.
2. Properly import all required libraries and dependencies.
3. Remove any unused variables, functions, or comments.
4. Refactor complex conditional statements into separate functions or variables for better readability.
5. Add proper error handling and validation for user inputs.
6. Define any missing functions like `formatDate()`.
7. Use correct syntax for quotation marks, parentheses, and brackets.
8. Test the code with various input scenarios to ensure its functionality and robustness.
